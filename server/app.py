api.add_resource(ProductionByID, "/productions/<int:id>")

# 1. User - POST
# - Create a User POST route by creating a class Users that inherits from Resource
# - Add the route '/users' with api.add_resource()
# - Create a POST method
# - use .get_json() to convert the request json
# - create a new user with the request data
# - add and commit the new user
# - Save the new users id to the session hash
# - Make a response and send it back to the client

# 2. Test this route in the client/src/components/Authentication.js

# 3. Create a Login route
# - Create a login class that inherits from Resource
# - Use api.add_resource to add the '/login' path
# - Build out the post method
# - convert the request from json and select the user name sent form the client.
# - Use the name to query the user with a .filter
# - If found set the user_id to the session hash
# - convert the user to_dict and send a response back to the client
# - Toggle the signup form to login and test the login route

# 4. Create an AuthorizedSession class that inherits from Resource
# - use api.add_resource to add an authorized route
# - Create a get method
# - Access the user_id from session with session.get
# - Use the user id to query the user with a .filter
# - If the user id is in sessions and found make a response to send to the client. else raise the Unauthorized exception (Note- Unauthorized is being imported from werkzeug.exceptions)

# 5. Head back to client/src/App.js to restrict access to our app!

# 6. Logout
# -  Create a class Logout that inherits from Resource
# -  Create a method called delete
# -  Clear the user id in session by setting the key to None
# -  create a 204 no content response to send back to the client

# 7. Navigate to client/src/components/Navigation.js to build the logout button!
